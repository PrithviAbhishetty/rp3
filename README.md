This Project investigated the ability of a Reinforcement Learning path planning algorithm to minimise flight costs in an
urban environment using Orographic Soaring.

The RL_Path_Planner.py file contains the code for the design of the Grid Map, the Markov Decision Process Environment Class 
and the implementation of PPO with an MLP policy to complete the design of the path planner. It also includes 
the code used to train, evaluate and test the algorithm with render capability.

The TestGridLayouts.py file contains the code for the different obstacle environments used in the control and variable 
wind-field experiments.
